# Paging Audit

## SmmPagingAudit

### Code Basics
SMM is a privileged mode of the ia32/x64 cpu architecture.  In this environment nearly all system state can 
be inspected including that of the operating system, kernel, and hypervisor.  Due to it's 
capabilities SMM has become an area of interest for those searching to exploit the system. 
To help minimize the interest and impact of an exploit in SMM the SMI handlers should operate
in a least privileged model.  To do this standard paging can be leveraged to limit the SMI
handlers access.  Tianocore has a feature to enable paging within SMM and this tool helps confirm
the configuration being used.  This tool requires three parts to get a complete view.  
 
### SMM
The SMM driver must be included in your build and dispatched to SMM before the End Of Dxe.  It is
recommended that this driver should only be used on debug builds as it reports the entire
SMM memory environment to the caller.  The shell app will communicate to the SMM driver and 
request critical memory information including IDT, GDT, page tables, and loaded images.

### App
The UEFI shell application collects system information from the DXE environment and then
communicates to the SMM driver/handler to collect necessary info from SMM.  It then 
writes this data to files and then that content is used by the windows scripts.  

## DxePagingAudit
The DXE Driver registers an event to be notified on Exit Boot Services (to change this, replace gEfiEventExitBootServicesGuid with a different event GUID).

## Windows
The Windows script will look at the *.DAT files, parse their content, check for errors
and then insert the formatted data into the Html report file.  This report file is then double-clickable
by the end user/developer to review the posture of the SMM environment.  The Results tab applies 
our suggested rules for SMM to show if the environment passes or fails.  
If it fails the filters on the data tab can be configured to show where the problem exists.  


## Usage / Enabling on EDK2 based system
First, for the SMM driver and app you need to add them to your DSC file for your project so they get compiled.

### SMM Paging Audit
```
[Components.X64]  
  UefiTestingPkg\AuditTests\PagingAudit\SmmPagingAudit\Smm\SmmPagingAuditSmm.inf  
  UefiTestingPkg\AuditTests\PagingAudit\SmmPagingAudit\App\SmmPagingAuditApp.inf
```

Next, you must add the SMM driver to a firmware volume in your FDF that can dispatch SMM modules.    
```
INF UefiTestingPkg\AuditTests\PagingAudit\SmmPagingAudit\Smm\SmmPagingAuditSmm.inf
```

Third, after compiling your new firmware you must:
1. flash that image on the system.  
2. Copy the SmmPagingAuditApp.efi to a USB key

Then, boot your system running the new firmware to the shell and run the app. The tool will create a set of *.dat files on the same USB key. 

On a Windows PC, run the Python script on the data found on your USB key.  

Finally, double-click the HTML output file and check your results.   

### DXE Paging Audit
```
[Components.X64] 
    UefiTestingPkg\AuditTests\PagingAudit\DxePagingAudit\DxePagingAudit.inf
```
Next, you must add the driver to a firmware volume in your FDF that can dispatch it.    
```
INF UefiTestingPkg\AuditTests\PagingAudit\DxePagingAudit\DxePagingAudit.inf
```

Third, after compiling your new firmware you must:
1. flash that image on the system.  

Then, boot your system running the new firmware to the shell with a USB plugged in.

If the USB disk is FS0:\, the files should be in FS1:\\. Copy them to the flash drive:
```
copy FS1:\*.dat FS0:\
```

On a Windows PC, run the Python script on the data found on your USB key.  

Finally, double-click the HTML output file and check your results.
