## @file
#  Library to parse page/translation table entries. This library
#  is restricted to UEFI_APPLICATION modules because it should be
#  used primarily for testing. For querying page attributes from
#  non-application modules, core services like the GCD or Memory
#  Attribute Protocol should be used to maintain coherency.
