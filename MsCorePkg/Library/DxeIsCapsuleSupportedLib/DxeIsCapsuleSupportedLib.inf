## @file
#  Library for checking if Capsules are supported by the current firmware
#  This includes some light validation and verification of the capsule
#  structure.
#
#  While this library says it is a RuntimeDriver, it will not work past the
#  memory change. For its use case it assumes the capsule interface will lock
#  at ExitBootServices.
