## @file
# This library has no API or Library function callers. In the entry point it will publish
# the DebugPortPpi using the containing module's DebugLib instance functions. This allows all
# other modules within PEI to use a thin shim DebugLib that leverages the functions in the PPI.
# This can provide a significant flash size savings for PEIMs which often have limited space.
