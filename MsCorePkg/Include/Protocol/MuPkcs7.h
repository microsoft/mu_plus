/**
  VerifyEKUsInPkcs7Signature()

  This function receives a PKCS7 formatted signature, and then verifies that 
  the specified Enhanced or Extended Key Usages (EKU's) are present in the end-entity 
  leaf signing certificate.

  Note that this function does not validate the certificate chain.
  
  Applications for custom EKU's are quite flexible.  For example, a policy EKU
  may be present in an Issuing Certificate Authority (CA), and any sub-ordinate
  certificate issued might also contain this EKU, thus constraining the 
  sub-ordinate certificate.  Other applications might allow a certificate 
  embedded in a device to specify that other Object Identifiers (OIDs) are
  present which contains binary data specifying custom capabilities that 
  the device is able to do.
 
  @param[in]  Pkcs7Signature     - The PKCS#7 signed information content block. An array
                                   containing the content block with both the signature,
                                   the signer's certificate, and any necessary intermediate
                                   certificates.
 
  @param[in]  Pkcs7SignatureSize - Number of bytes in Pkcs7Signature.
 
  @param[in]  RequiredEKUs       - Array of null-terminated strings listing OIDs of
                                   required EKUs that must be present in the signature.
 
  @param[in]  RequiredEKUsSize   - Number of elements in the RequiredEKUs string array.

  @param[in]  RequireAllPresent  - If this is TRUE, then all of the specified EKU's
                                   must be present in the leaf signer.  If it is
                                   FALSE, then we will succeed if we find any
                                   of the specified EKU's.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS            - The required EKUs were found in the signature.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER  - A parameter was invalid.
  @retval EFI_NOT_FOUND          - One or more EKU's were not found in the signature.
