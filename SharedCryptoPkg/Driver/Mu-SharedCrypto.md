## About

The purpose of this package is to provide a wrapper around BaseCryptLib without having to compile the EFI. In theory, linking against BaseCryptLib should give you a higher rate of compression since it will inline code, but in practice the linker gets clever and messes things up.

It is comprised of a Library Instance that is called SharedCryptoLib. It is contains many of the functions included by BaseCryptLib as well as a few more (mainly X509 related stuff). The library simply locates the protocol and then calls the protocol version of BaseCryptLib (SharedCryptoProtocol). It should be a drop in replacement for the BaseCryptLib. Alternatively, you call the protocol directly.

The protocol is installed by a prebuilt EFI that gets downloaded via nuget. The EFI is packaged for consumption via an INF that is loaded and installed.

## Building SharedCryptoPkg

There are two pieces to be build: the library and the driver. The library is to be included in your project

There are 24 different versions of the prebuild driver. One for each arch (X86, AARCH64, ARM, X64) and for each phase (DXE, PEI, SMM) and for mode (DEBUG, RELEASE). The nuget system should take care of downloading the correct version for your project.

## Supported Architectures
This currently supports x86, x64, AARCH64, and ARM.

# Including in your platform

There are two ways to include this in your project: getting the protocol directly or using SharedCryptoLib. SharedCryptoLib is a wrapper that is a super set of the API for BaseCryptLib so you can just drop it in.



## Sample DSC change

This would replace where you would normally include BaseCryptLib.

```
[LibraryClasses.X64]
    BaseCryptLib|SharedCryptoPkg/Library/SharedCryptoLib/SharedCryptoLibDxe.inf
    ...

[LibraryClasses.IA32.PEIM]
    BaseCryptLib|SharedCryptoPkg/Library/SharedCryptoLib/SharedCryptoLibPei.inf
    ...

[LibraryClasses.DXE_SMM]
    BaseCryptLib|SharedCryptoPkg/Library/SharedCryptoLib/SharedCryptoLibSmm.inf
    ...
```

## Sample FDF change

TODO: re-evluate this once nuget dependency is live
Include this file in your FV and the module will get loaded.

```
[FV.FVDXE]
    INF  SharedCryptoPkg/Package/SharedCryptoPkgDxe.inf
    ...
    ...
```
