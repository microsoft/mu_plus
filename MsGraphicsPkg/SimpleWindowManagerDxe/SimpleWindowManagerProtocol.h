    @param[in]  StringInfo  Points to the string output information,
                            including the color and font. If NULL, then

                            If this points to a NULL on entry, then a buffer
                            will be allocated to hold the generated image and
                            the pointer updated on exit. It is the caller's
                            responsibility to free this buffer.

                            edge of the image of the first character
