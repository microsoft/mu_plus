# Color Bar Display Device State Library

## About

There are a number of states that are critical when manufacturing a system.
Some of these are the fuses that must be set that protect the device.
These fuses are not set on some machines for test purposes, etc.

To quickly notice that these customer critical settings are correct, this library display color
bars on the display if there state is not in the secure state.

This allows an end user to quickly notice that secure boot is off.

This allows an end of line tester to verify that the fuses are in the correct state for
customer delivery.
