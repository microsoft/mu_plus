  Policy Engine Runtime Variables
  Below are the variables that control MFCI Policy change requests.  They are
  non-volatile and both visible and writable from the OS.
  To set a new policy, write a correctly-signed, correctly-nonced, correctly
  targeted policy to NEXT_MFCI_POLICY_BLOB_VARIABLE_NAME variable and reboot.
  To delete an MFCI policy and return to default device policy, delete
  CURRENT_MFCI_POLICY_BLOB_VARIABLE_NAME and reboot.
  In both cases, the policy state change is processed during the DXE phase of
  the next boot, listeners are notified, and the system will reboot a second
  time so that the PEI phase can take action based upon the new policy.

  attempt to authenticate and install during the DXE phase of the subsequent boot

/**
  Policy Engine Per-Device Targeting Variable Names
  Below are the variable names that are populated by OEM code during the DXE phase to enable per-device
  policy targeting.

  The variables below are locked (become Read-Only) using variable policy immediately
  prior to BDS (gMsStartOfBdsNotifyGuid), and cannot be modified by an OS.

  The variable values are wide-NULL-terminated CHAR16's.  They may contain UTF-16 values (full Unicode
  beyond the range of UC2 that is supported in UEFI), but should not contain Unicode escape sequences.
  Why?  The web interfaces that provide for generation of binary policies may accept UTF-8 JSON including
  escape sequences, but they will expand these into unescaped UTF-16 prior to generation of the signed
  policy binaries.
