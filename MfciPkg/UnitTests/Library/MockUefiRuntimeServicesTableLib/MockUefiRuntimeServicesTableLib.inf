#  Mock implementation of the UEFI Runtime Services Table Library.
#
#  This mocked version library provides a shim layer that links the
#  gRT symbol to test specific runtime services table implementations.
#
#  For unit tests needing to access runtime services, such as getting
#  and setting variables, would implement their own runtime services
#  table and the needed functionality under the name of `mMockRuntime`.
#  The unit test should link to this instance of UefiRuntimeServicesTableLib
#  from the corresponding host test dsc file.
