# MfciRetrievePolicyLib: NULL edition

## About

Platforms are not generally expected to implement this library, as MFCI carries known implementations,
thus it's header is under MfciPkg/Private/...  
This library abstracts where MfciDxe retrieves the cached, current policy.
On platforms with a PEI phase, it may retrieve the policy from a HOB.
On platforms that lack a PEI phase, it may retrieve the policy from a UEFI variable.
