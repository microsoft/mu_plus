# CodeQL Result Filters for Packages in Mu Plus
#
# Note:
#   1. Packages that use Mu Plus can reuse this file to quickly pick up the
#      same filters applied to results in the Mu Plus repo.
#   2. It is recommended paths begin with `**/` in filter files residing in repos that
#      are used as dependencies by other repos (e.g. Common/MU). That way the filter
#      will apply both in Mu Plus directly and regardless of where Mu Plus is
#      located within a downstream repos directory hierarchy.
