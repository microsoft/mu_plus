# Platform Integration of DFCI

This section of documentation is focused on UEFI firmware developers and helping them enable their platforms with the DFCI feature.  

DFCI consists mostly of a software feature that is written in the DXE phase of UEFI.  It has numerous architecture and platform independent modules with only a few required platform libraries.  It also requires the platform adhere to and use the DFCI components to ensure the DFCI features work as designed.  Finally to enable an End-To-End management scenario there maybe custom requirements in adjacent UEFI firmware components.

## Dfci Menu application

The [DfciMenu](https://github.com/microsoft/mu_plus/tree/dev/201908/DfciPkg/Application/DfciMenu) application is optimized for **mu_plus MsGraphicsPkg**.  It is VFR but since many platforms use custom layouts and graphical representation this area might need some adjustments.  The DfciMenu application publishes a HII formset that should be located by your pre-boot UEFI menu application (e.g. "FrontPage") and displayed.

* Formset GUID: `gDfciMenuFormsetGuid = {0x3b82283d, 0x7add, 0x4c6a, {0xad, 0x2b, 0x71, 0x9b, 0x8d, 0x7b, 0x77, 0xc9 }}`
* Entry Form: `#define DFCI_MENU_FORM_ID           0x2000`
* Source Location: `DfciPkg\Application\DfciMenu`

## DFCI DXE Drivers

| Dxe Driver | Location |

| SettingsManager.efi | DfciPkg/SettingsManager/SettingsManagerDxe.inf |
| DfciMenu.inf | DfciPkg/Application/DfciMenu/DfciMenu.inf |

## DFCI Core Libraries

*These DFCI Standard libraries are expected to be used as is for standard functionality.*

| Library | Location |
| --- | ---|
| DfciRecoveryLib | DfciPkg/Library/DfciRecoveryLib/DfciRecoveryLib.inf |
| DfciSettingsLib | DfciPkg/Library/DfciSettingsLib/DfciSettingsLib.inf |

## DFCI Platform provided libraries

The following libraries have to be provided by the platform:

| Library | Documentation | Function |
| ----- | -----| ----- |
| DfciDeviceIdSupportLib | [Documentation](DfciDeviceIdSupportLib.md) | Provides SMBIOS information - Manufacturer, Product, and Serial number |
| DfciGroupLib | [Documentation](DfciGroups.md) | Provides lists of platform settings that are in the Dfci group settings.
| DfciUiSupportLib | [Documentation](DfciUiSupportLib.md) | Provides UI for various user interactions |

## DFCI Setting Providers

Setting providers is how a platform provides a setting to DFCI

[Setting detailed overview](DfciSettingProviders.md)

## Mu Changes

* DFCI Recovery service uses HTTPS certificates with Subject Alternative Names.  This requires a source modification to NetworkPkg, [removal of EFI_TLS_VERIFY_FLAG_NO_WILDCARDS from TlsConfigureSession()](https://github.com/microsoft/mu_basecore/commit/931ff1a45ce13a6a8c3e296f89c6de21f23a17ed#diff-620e10fa41a63814688b931d19fefa89R628).
* [Configure OpenSSL to support modern TLS ciphers](https://github.com/microsoft/mu_tiano_plus/commit/1f3b135ddc821718a78c352316197889c5d3e0c2)

## Platform DSC statements

Adding DFCI to your system consists of:

1. Write your settings providers. Use **DfciPkg/Library/DfciSampleProvider**.
2. Writing three library classes for the DfciDeviceIdSupportLib, DfciGroupLib, and DfciUiSupportLib.
3. Adding the DSC sections below.
4. Adding the FDF sections below.
