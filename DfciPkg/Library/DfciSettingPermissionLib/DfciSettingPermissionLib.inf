# This library provides all the logic for the SettingsManager to use for Permission Management.
# This library should not be linked in by other modules as it used only by the Settings Manager.
# If modules want to find out a permission value they should use the SettingAccessProtocol which will return
# flags indicating write access
#
# This library has a very small public interface but it has a lot of
# logic required to support Permissions, Provioning Permissions from tool thru variable interface, etc
