# Components Section - list of the modules and components that will be processed by compilation
#                      tools and the EDK II tools to generate PE32/PE32+/Coff image files.
#
# Note: The EDK II DSC file is not used to specify how compiled binary images get placed
#       into firmware volume images. This section is just a list of modules to compile from
#       source into UEFI-compliant binaries.
#       It is the FDF file that contains information on combining binary files into firmware
#       volume images, whose concept is beyond UEFI and is described in PI specification.
#       Binary modules do not need to be listed in this section, as they should be
#       specified in the FDF file. For example: Shell binary (Shell_Full.efi), FAT binary (Fat.efi),
#       Logo (Logo.bmp), and etc.
#       There may also be modules listed in this section that are not required in the FDF file,
#       When a module listed here is excluded from FDF file, then UEFI-compliant binary will be
#       generated for it, but the binary will not be put into any firmware volume.
